# Line Group-Based Point Cloud Registration via Weighted Hough Transform and Bipartite Graph Matching Approach

Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in various applications, including 3D scene reconstruction, cultural heritage preservation, and deformation monitoring. This code implements a parallel line group-based PCR algorithm using the weighted Hough transform and the maximal weight bipartite graph matching.
